correct:

After commit:  <History: "Added README.md" with children [] and thread <History: "Initial commit" with children [] and thread None>>
Reascended:  <History: "Initial commit" with children [<History: "Added README.md" with children [] and thread None>] and thread None>
Invalid descend (no change):  <History: "Initial commit" with children [] and thread None>
